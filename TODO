- Need to pull security ID out of "instrument" URL
- Add tests for return calculations with dividends
- Change historical data format to data/YYYY/MM/dd/hh/mm/ss/YYYY-MM-dd-hh-mm-ss.json
- Consider using get_current_positions() instead of build_holdings()
- Conslidate public APIs for each object (make add_holding() a private method)
  - Need to think about client use cases across classes and define methods as
    simply as possible
  - Only need to test public methods (methods accessible from other classes)
- Display annualized return in output tables
- Bunch holdings that aren't in portfolio config in "Other" Asset Class and
  report return
- 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://api.robinhood.com/orders/
- Support all types of portfolio configuration updates (i.e., security and asset class removals in addition to additions)
- Handle 400 case where you have to use a limit order
- Tie data closer to API responses and less from simulated data
- Handle various responses from order_buy_market(). Look into changing it to buy limit order
- Look into test coverage library and implement on this project, need more testing
- Clean up code style in AssetClass.plan_purchases() (don't have to use cents)
- Add validation function to check portfolio config
- Add README documentation
