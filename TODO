- Figure out why table titles aren't showing up
- Define schemas for all the API response types
- Add return data to console output on a per-security and per-asset class basis
- Support all types of portfolio configuration updates (i.e., security and asset class removals in addition to additions)
- Handle 400 case where you have to use a limit order
- Tie data closer to API responses and less from simulated data
- Handle various responses from order_buy_market(). Look into changing it to buy limit order
- Look into test coverage library and implement on this project, need more testing
- Add average buy-price, current price, and return into display
- Clean up code style in AssetClass.plan_purchases() (don't have to use cents)
