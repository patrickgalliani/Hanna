- Fix bug: Biocept return is -0.3% even though cost and value are both $1.05
- "Asset Class" -> "Security Group"
- Add onboarding for new users (portfolio config/credentials setup)
    - Add sanity checking and retry capability for user responses in onboard.py
    - Validate functionality by creating personal portfolio config with
      onboard.py
    - Add credentials into onboard script
- Build UI that shows the two tables - single refresh button that calls
  refresh()
- Buy "unknown" security and verify behavior of "Other" asset class
- Write unit test for latest_ds()
- Fix trade rejection logic
- Conslidate public APIs for each object (make add_holding() a private method)
  - Need to think about client use cases across classes and define methods as
    simply as possible
  - Only need to test public methods (methods accessible from other classes)
- 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://api.robinhood.com/orders/
- Support all types of portfolio configuration updates (i.e., security and asset class removals in addition to additions)
- Handle 400 case where you have to use a limit order
- Tie data closer to API responses and less from simulated data
- Handle various responses from order_buy_market(). Look into changing it to buy limit order
- Look into test coverage library and implement on this project, need more testing
- Clean up code style in AssetClass.plan_purchases() (don't have to use cents)
- Add validation function to check portfolio config
- Add README documentation
